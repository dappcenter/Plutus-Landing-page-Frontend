            Plutus is an interface that allows game developers to create smart in-game items on the blockchain. Developers have the freedom to mint fungible, non-fungible, tradable, non-tradable, finite, or infinite in-game items which they can integrate into their games using our custom SDK. In-game items on the blockchain mean that gamers have the right to own their in-game items and use them wherever they can be used. Gamers can freely trade their items or exchange them for real-world currency. Developers can also program custom functionality into their items such as deterioration. We want to ensure that decentralized in-game items donâ€™t take away from a developer's monetary success, and want to ensure those game developers can still earn revenue from their in-game items, even after they are sold.
